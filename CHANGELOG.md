# Changelog

All notable changes to PortfolioIQ are documented here.
Format: [Semantic Version] — Date, with Added / Changed / Fixed / Removed sections.

## [0.19.0] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- `app.py`: Navigating away from Dashboard (to INPUT, GUIDE, or SETTINGS) now clears `_dashboard_details`, so returning to Dashboard always shows the main dashboard, not a More Details sub-page.

### Changed
- `pages/details_q1.py`, `details_q2.py`, `details_q3.py`: Replaced Key Metrics `st.dataframe` summary tables with `st.metric()` grids (2 per row) carrying `help=` tooltip text on every metric.
- `pages/details_q3.py` `_render_preparedness_panel()`: Converted 11-signal HTML card grid to `st.metric()` tiles; interpretation text moved into the `help=` tooltip. Unused color imports removed.

---

## [0.18.0] — 2026-03-15

### Changed
- `components/dashboard_quad.py`: Added `help=kpi.get("help")` to `st.metric()` calls — renders inline `?` tooltip on hover for every KPI tile. Removed "Explain Numbers" toggle button and explain panel block. "More Details →" is now the only action button per quadrant.
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_build_q1/q2/q3/q4()`: Added `"help"` key to all 16 KPI dicts with concise 1–2 sentence tooltip text per metric.
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_health_indicators()`: Reordered health signals — Market Stress → Return Quality → Volatility → Drawdown Risk → Diversification → Efficiency.
- `pages/details_q1.py`, `details_q2.py`, `details_q3.py`, `details_q4.py`: Removed "All Metrics" dataframe table and "Explain Numbers" toggle + explain panel from all four details screens.

### Removed
- `components/explain_panel.py` is now unreferenced — no longer called from any page.

---

## [0.17.0] — 2026-03-15

### Fixed
- `assets/style.css`: Ticker tape animation class mismatch — HTML used `ticker-tape`/`ticker-tape-content`; CSS targets `ticker-tape-container`/`ticker-tape-track`. Fixed HTML class names in `_render_ticker_tape()`. (TL-003)
- `assets/style.css`: Ticker scroll speed reduced from 60s to 30s for better readability.
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_render_holdings_strip()`: Replaced per-ticker price columns with a single full-width stacked segmented breakdown bar; each ticker gets a color-coded segment proportional to weight, labelled with symbol and percentage. (TL-005 / TL-016)
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_check_loaded()`: "Go to Input →" button did nothing — now sets `_nav_pending` + reruns correctly. (TL-014 related)
- `components/charts.py` `correlation_heatmap()`: Text on near-zero (white background) cells was invisible — changed to `#000000` for abs(val) < 0.6, `COLOR_TEXT` for abs(val) >= 0.6. (TL-008)
- `analytics/risk_factors.py` `fetch_sector_weights()`: ETFs labeled "Unknown" sector — added `quoteType` check; ETF/MUTUALFUND quote types now labeled "ETF / Fund". (TL-009)
- `assets/config.py` `STRESS_SCENARIOS`: Reordered to chronological — 2000 Dot-Com → 2008 GFC → 2020 COVID → 2022 Rate Shock. (TL-011)
- `pages/details_q4.py`: Warning title changed from "Estimation Error Warning" to "Optimizer Assumptions". (TL-012)
- `pages/settings.py`: Weight bounds and drift threshold sliders showed "0 to 0" / "1 to 1" — switched from float (0.0–1.0) + `format="%.0f%%"` to integer (0–100) + `format="%d%%"`, converting back to decimal on save. (TL-015)
- `app.py` + `pages/input.py`: Auto-redirect to Dashboard after re-analyse failed on second run — replaced `key="nav_radio"` approach (blocked by Streamlit widget-state restriction) with `_nav_pending` / `_current_nav` plain-key pattern; `index=` only passed to radio when programmatic override is needed, eliminating two-click lag. (TL-014)

## [0.16.0] — 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_health_indicators()`: Drawdown Risk indicator read `perf.get("max_drawdown")` — key lives in `risk_factors`. Fixed to `rf.get("max_drawdown")`.
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_build_q1()`: Max DD KPI tile read `perf.get("max_drawdown")` — same wrong dict. Fixed to `analytics.get(SK_RISK_FACTORS, {}).get("max_drawdown")`.
- `pages/dashboard.py` `_build_q2()`: Correlation heatmap read `rf.get("correlation_matrix")` — correct key is `"corr_matrix"`. Fixed. Was always rendering the empty fallback figure.
- `components/explain_panel.py` Q1 panel: Max Drawdown display read `perf.get("max_drawdown")`. Fixed to `rf.get("max_drawdown")`.

### Added
- `README.md`: full project README — quickstart, project structure, analytics methodology summary (all 4 layers), test instructions, configuration table, navigation guide, tech stack table, disclaimer.
